# descobrimentos-simulator

A small HTML5/Javascript game for our Multimedia class project. CreateJS is used as the main Framework, for ease of development.

Descobrimentos Simulator is a game where you play the role of Portugal's administrator during the XIV-XVI centuries, guiding the events known as
"Descobrimentos". As the country's ruler, your job is to develop your navy fleet and expand your territory through harvesting of resources, development
of the colonies and defending your people and territories from pirate's attacks and foreign invasions. 

With rich visuals and animations, the game is not only aimed to provide a challenge to the most seasoned gamers, but also to teach, in a fun and interactive
way, the portuguese feats that changed the shape of the world to children and grown-ups alike.
